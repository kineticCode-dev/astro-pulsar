# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- CI workflow that runs type checking and build on every push to `main` and every pull request
- `Footer` component `showCopyright` and `compact` props to control copyright visibility and padding
- `Layout` component `compactFooter` prop, forwarded to `Footer`

### Changed
- Upgraded to Astro 6 with the new loader-based content collections API (`src/content.config.ts`, `glob()` loader)
- Upgraded to Tailwind CSS v4, configured via `@tailwindcss/vite` Vite plugin — no config file needed; dark mode now uses `@custom-variant` in CSS
- Replaced `standard-version` with plain `npm version` for releases — changelog is now maintained manually in Keep a Changelog format
- Simplified release workflow: replaced `softprops/action-gh-release` with built-in `gh release create`; build artifact is shared between jobs via `actions/upload-artifact` to avoid a double build
- Release pipeline now uses `env:` blocks for all dynamic values to eliminate injection risk
